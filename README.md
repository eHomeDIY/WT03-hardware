# WT03-hardware

Schematic and PCB design files for the project.

They are generated with EasyEDA.

Some notes regarding the designs:
The diode D1's package was larger than in the design, additional drilling will be needed for it to fit. Will be corrected in a future revision

The ground plane for the regulator U4 is an overkill, will be corrected in a future revision.

Mounting holes are also larger than required for the used enclosure. Will be corrected in a future revision.
